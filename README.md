# API Integration

The Travel Advisor App sources its data from two powerful APIs to deliver a comprehensive and delightful travel experience.

Travel Advisor API:
The Travel Advisor API serves as the backbone of our app, providing access to a reliable and extensive database of travel-related information. It offers up-to-date and accurate details about various destinations, including restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions. By leveraging this API, we ensure that you receive the latest and most relevant information to plan your adventures with confidence.

Google Maps API:
As an essential component of the Travel Advisor App, the Google Maps API adds a new dimension to your travel planning. This integration empowers you to visualize and explore the locations of restaurants, hotels, and tourist spots on an interactive map. With Google Maps' real-time navigation, you can effortlessly navigate your way to the best places and make the most of your travel journey.

By combining the Travel Advisor API and Google Maps API, we provide a seamless and enriching user experience. From finding the finest dining spots to locating the perfect hotel and discovering hidden gems, our app is your all-in-one travel companion. The integration of these APIs ensures that you embark on unforgettable adventures with the most accurate and insightful information at your fingertips.

Please note that the Travel Advisor App is not affiliated with the Travel Advisor API or Google Maps API. We are grateful to these APIs and their creators for enabling us to build an exceptional travel app for the community.
